# Setup

Install the [stylebot.me Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha). In [Chrome Extension settings](chrome://extensions/), navigate to the stylebot extension, and the Styles tab. Click the "Add a new style" button and use the following url pattern:

    http://www.espn.com.au/nba/boxscore, http://www.espn.com.au/nba/playbyplay

Then paste the CSS from this repo (espn-boxscores.css) in the textfield below. Click save and refresh the boxscore page.

#Notes

- Feel free to chop and change this.
- This is super-rough at this stage and was intended for personal use.
- I may consider rolling this out as a dedicated Chrome plugin if there's sufficient interest.
